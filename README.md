# End-to-End Real-World Data Engineering Project with Databricks

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data engineering pipeline using Databricks for a multinational retail corporation, **GlobalRetail**. The goal is to implement a modern data lakehouse architecture to consolidate and analyze data from multiple sources, enabling scalable, real-time analytics and reporting. The solution reduces data processing time, improves inventory forecasting, enhances personalization, and enables efficient decision-making.

### Objectives
- Reduce data processing time from 72 hours to under 6 hours.
- Improve inventory forecasting accuracy by 25%.
- Increase customer personalization for a 15% boost in repeat purchases.
- Enable near real-time financial reporting.

## Tech Stack
- **Databricks**: Unified data engineering and analytics platform.
- **Delta Lake**: Open-source storage layer providing ACID transactions.
- **Power BI**: Data visualization and reporting.
- **PySpark**: Data processing framework.

## Data Sources
1. **Customer Data**:
   - CSV files from the CRM system (~500M records).
2. **Product Catalog**:
   - JSON files from the inventory management system (~0.5M SKUs).
3. **Transaction History**:
   - Parquet files from POS and e-commerce platforms (~10B records annually).

## Project Flow
1. **Bronze Layer (Raw Data)**:
   - Ingest raw data from multiple sources (CSV, JSON, Parquet).
   - Store data as-is for auditability.

2. **Silver Layer (Processed Data)**:
   - Clean and transform data (e.g., handle schema evolution, apply business rules).
   - Merge incremental data for daily updates.

3. **Gold Layer (Aggregated Data)**:
   - Generate business-specific aggregated data models.
   - Provide optimized datasets for analytics and reporting.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Create Power BI dashboards for real-time insights into sales and operations.

## Prerequisites
- **Databricks Account**: Set up a Databricks workspace.
- **Power BI Desktop**: Install Power BI for data visualization.
- **Python Knowledge**: Familiarity with PySpark and SQL.

## Setup Instructions
### 1. Databricks Environment Setup
1. Create a Databricks workspace.
2. Enable DBFS (Databricks File System).
3. Set up the following layers in the DBFS:
   - `bronze/`
   - `silver/`
   - `gold/`
   - `notebooks/`

### 2. Data Upload
1. Upload the source files to their respective folders in the `bronze/` layer:
   - `customer.csv`
   - `product.json`
   - `transaction.parquet`

### 3. Run Notebooks
1. **Bronze Layer**:
   - Load raw data into Delta tables (`bronze_customer`, `bronze_products`, `bronze_transactions`).
   - Archive processed files.
2. **Silver Layer**:
   - Clean and transform data.
   - Merge incremental updates into `silver_customer`, `silver_products`, `silver_transactions` tables.
3. **Gold Layer**:
   - Generate aggregated datasets (e.g., daily sales, sales by category).

### 4. Visualization Setup
1. Integrate Power BI with Databricks:
   - Use the JDBC/ODBC connection details.
   - Generate a personal access token in Databricks.
2. Load Gold Layer tables into Power BI.
3. Create dashboards to visualize insights such as daily sales trends and category-wise sales distribution.

## Key Learnings
- **Data Lakehouse Architecture**:
  - Combines the scalability of data lakes with the transactional reliability of data warehouses.
- **Incremental Data Processing**:
  - Efficiently updates Silver and Gold layers using Delta Lake.
- **Data Transformation**:
  - Applied business logic (e.g., customer segmentation, order status).
- **Visualization**:
  - Leveraged Power BI for actionable insights and reporting.
  - Handling data quality challenges and ensuring business rule compliance

## Conclusion
This project highlights the power of Databricks and Delta Lake in building scalable, real-world data engineering solutions. It showcases how a modern data lakehouse architecture can address complex data consolidation, transformation, and analysis challenges, driving better decision-making across business units.
